 
# Studio Ghibli 
An interactive website where users can browse through Studio Ghibli movies and characters. On the Films page, there is the possibility to sort the movies alphabetically, by release date or run time. Clicking on the movie cards causes the cards to flip over and reveal a brief description of the movie. The Characters page displays a few protagonists, and includes each of their name, gender and age. The third page of this app is called Sevs' Watched list: this page displays movies that I have personally watched and is a great way for me to keep track of my list. The cards on this page also flip. 
 
## Purpose of this project
I really wanted to build an app that was personal to me, and that I would use in the real world. This website allowed me to practice accessing selective data from objects and rendering them in a unique way using flipping cards. The data is originally from an API, however is not dynamically fetched from its original source. As I wanted to add properties to the returned objects from the API, I decided to GET the information through Postman and copy paste the desired data in a data file in the project. I then added a few properties such as the image URLs, and characters information. This app was a great way of deepening my understanding of SCSS and JavaScript to create the flipping cards.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
